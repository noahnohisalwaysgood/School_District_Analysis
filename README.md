# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis
The school board has notified Maria and her supervisor that the report shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. Even though the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards and have turned to Maria for help. She has asked me to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact. Maria would like you to repeat the school district analysis that you did in this module and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.
